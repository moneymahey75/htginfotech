Edge Function Deployment Required

The following edge function has been modified and requires deployment:
- create-payment-intent

Reason for manual deployment:
The mcp__supabase__deploy_edge_function tool is experiencing a technical issue
with error: "A database is already setup for this project"

This error appears to be a bug in the MCP server configuration and affects all
Supabase MCP operations including list_edge_functions, deploy_edge_function,
and execute_sql.

Deployment Commands:
1. Using Supabase CLI:
   npx supabase functions deploy create-payment-intent

2. Using Supabase Dashboard:
   Navigate to Edge Functions → create-payment-intent → Deploy

Changes Made:
- Fixed payment split logic (was sending 100% to connected account)
- Added diagnostic logging for troubleshooting
- Corrected percentage calculations
